# cdir

cdir allows you to quickly navigate to a directory recorded into your history.

When you use the `cd` command in your terminal, `cdir` records the directory into its database.
Then you can use the graphical user interface to go back to it later.
The GUI has text filtering capabilities, and it shows the date of the last time you went to it.

cdir also supports creating shortcuts for frequently used directories.

Documentation and installation guidelines are available at: [Documentation](https://amadeusitgroup.github.io/cdir/)
