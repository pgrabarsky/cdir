# Navigating the UI

You can open the UI by typing ```c``` in your terminal.

There are three main views:

1. *Directory history view:* List of previously visited directories, sorted by most recent visit, with last visit date.

1. *Shortcuts view:* List of defined shortcuts.

1. *Help view:* Shows available commands.

Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch between the first two views, and <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd> for help.

* <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Go to selected directory

* <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd>: Exit and stay in current directory

* <kbd>Up/Down</kbd>: Select directory (<kbd>Shift</kbd> for bigger jumps)

* <kbd>Page Up/Page Down</kbd>: Scroll by page

* <kbd>Home</kbd>: Go to most recent directory (the top)

* <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd>: Show full directory path

* <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>: Delete selected entry

* <kbd>Ctrl+E</kbd> (shortcuts view): Edit description

Also, you can simply type a string to filter directories history or shortcuts.
